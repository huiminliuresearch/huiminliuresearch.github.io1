## Research

## Teaching
* Instructor of THM 4322 Designing Tourism Experiences (in-person) 

I taught this course independently in 2022 Fall. This course presents an overview of the process of designing effective tourism hardware (attractions, etc.) and software (programs, special events, etc.). Students will learn how to define effective tourism experiences that add value to the visitor experience and how to measure and evaluate these experiences using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Furthermore, students will learn customer experience marketing and management principles to promote affinity and loyalty among tourism consumer groups.
